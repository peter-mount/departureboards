        This application provides real time departure board information for every railway station in England, Scotland and Wales as well as every station on
        the London Underground.
        When you navigate through the site, you will be shown the trains for up to the next hour.

    <h3>National Rail Enquiries</h3>

    <p>
        For the mainline stations, the application is a view on the Darwin Push Port real time feed from National Rail Enquiries.
    </p>

    <p>
        This feed provides both timetabled times for services but also actual as well as the predicted arrival &amp; departure times for services,
        so when a service is delayed then we will show the same predicted times as National Rail Enquiries have access to.
    </p>

    <h3>Transport for London</h3>

    <p>
        For the London underground, we are using feeds from Transport for London which provide similar information for underground services.
